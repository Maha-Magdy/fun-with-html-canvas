# Fun With HTML Canvas

## About

Fun with HTML5 Canvas is an interactive and vibrant project that lets you unleash your creativity on a digital canvas! This project leverages the power of HTML5 canvas to provide you with a playful environment where you can paint, draw, and experiment with colors in a rainbow palette.

*PS: After being inspired by Wes Bos' JAVASCRIPT30 course, I decided to follow it and build the Fun with HTML5 canvas to keep my hands dirty with JavaScript.*
